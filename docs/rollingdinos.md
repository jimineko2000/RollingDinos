# Rolling Dinos

---
This app is a puzzle game where you control 16 dinosaurs on the game board. 

If you can align dinosaurs of the same color in a row, the stage is cleared.

The only way to move the dinosaurs is to press the 9 spin buttons embedded on the game board. 

Think carefully and guide the dinosaurs to the desired location in a limited number of times!

The rules are simple, but it's a challenging puzzle game. 

From children to the elderly, please try playing.
